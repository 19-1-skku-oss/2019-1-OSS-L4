Mattermost is an open source Slack-alternative used by thousands of companies around the world in 14 languages. Learn more at [https://about.mattermost.com](https://about.mattermost.com).

You can download our apps from the [App Store](https://about.mattermost.com/mattermost-ios-app/) or [Google Play Store](https://about.mattermost.com/mattermost-android-app/), or [build them yourself](https://developers.mattermost.com/contribute/mobile/build-your-own/). 

We plan on releasing monthly updates with new features - check the [changelog](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for what features are currently supported! 

**Important:** If you self-compile the Mattermost Mobile apps you also need to deploy your own [Mattermost Push Notification Service](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-push-proxy/releases).

# Frequently Asked Questions

### How is data handled on mobile devices after a user account is deactivated?

App data is wiped from the device when a user logs out of the app. If the user is logged in when the account is deactivated, then within one minute the system logs the user out, and as a result all app data is wiped from the device.

### Can I connect to multiple Mattermost servers using the mobile apps?

At the moment, we only support connecting to one server at a time. If you need to connect to multiple servers, please [upvote the feature request](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457/suggestions/10975938) so we can track demand for it. 

As a work around, you can install both the released "Mattermost" app and sign up to be a [tester](#testing) for the "Mattermost Beta" app so you can connect to two servers at once.

### Will there be second generation apps available for tablets?

We plan to add support for tablets in the future, but the timeline depends on how many people have a need for it. If you're looking for a tablet version, please help us out by [upvoting the feature request](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457/suggestions/20082079)!

# Troubleshooting

### I keep getting a message "Cannot connect to the server. Please check your server URL and internet connection."

This sometimes appears when there is an issue with the SSL certitificate configuration. 

To check that your SSL certificate is set up correctly, test the SSL certificate by visiting a site such as https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html. If there’s an error about the missing chain or certificate path, there is likely an intermediate certificate missing that needs to be included.

Please note that the apps cannot connect to servers with self-signed certificates, consider using [Let's Encrypt](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/config-ssl-http2-nginx.html) instead. 

### I see a “Connecting…” bar that does not go away

If your app is working properly, you should see a grey “Connecting…” bar that clears or says “Connected” after the app reconnects. 

If you are seeing this message all the time, and your internet connection seems fine: 

Ask your server administrator if the server uses NGINX or another webserver as a reverse proxy. If so, they should check that it is configured correctly for [supporting the websocket connection for APIv4 endpoints](https://docs.mattermost.com/install/install-ubuntu-1604.html#configuring-nginx-as-a-proxy-for-mattermost-server).
